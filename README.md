# LoRa-System

Our concept is based on the new-gen tech phone with the competitive features(Affordble, Legal, Long range, Sustainable), To develop this  device, we found a new IoT(Internet of Things) communication protocol and module, it calls "LoRa"(now own and dev by Smetech Comp.) and it have some cool advancemments, and it also follow the law of the radio ISM (industry, science, medical) frequency range.
So we design a device which can control by phone or do it independence work, and to have the function of SOS call system which can use in the rutal area and mountain.
Our device can sent regular text and SOS call(also text) and some data from board module.
